# Signal Processing

This repo gathers the practical lab work developed as part of the signal processing course at university. The project includes implementations covering essential topics such as signal interpretation, filtering, Fourier transform, and time series processing/analysis. In addition, it features several implemented models for signal analysis – ranging from prediction and classification models to adaptive methods – showcasing the practical application of theoretical signal processing concepts.
